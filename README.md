#  Network Threat Hunting & Traffic Analysis Labs with Wireshark

Welcome to my **Threat Hunting and Incident Response Lab Repository** â€” a collection of hands-on projects where I simulate and investigate various network-based attacks using **Wireshark**, **NSM tools**, and other analysis techniques. Each lab documents a specific threat scenario with supporting packet captures, filters, tools, and findings.

This repository is part of my learning journey in **cybersecurity** as I pursue a role in **SOC analysis**, **network defense**, or **threat detection**.

##  Tools Used

- **Wireshark** â€“ for packet capture and in-depth protocol analysis
- **Ettercap** â€“ for simulating ARP poisoning attacks
- **CyberChef** â€“ for decoding payloads and base64 strings
- **VirusTotal** â€“ for IP, domain, and hash reputation lookup
- **NSM Tools** â€“ for contextualizing network metadata
- **VirtualBox** â€“ lab environment with Kali Linux, Ubuntu, and Windows Server

## Lab Projects Included

Each folder includes:
- Packet capture (PCAP or PCAPNG)
- Screenshots and analysis
- Applied filters and investigation steps
- Threat detection logic and key findings

## Learning Objectives

- Simulate and detect real-world network attacks
- Practice packet filtering and protocol analysis
- Strengthen threat hunting logic and hypothesis building
- Understand attacker behavior and indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Gain confidence with tools used by SOC analysts and blue teams
